## Implementation of a Database of Guitar Heroes


In this repository you can find a file named ```guitarists.py``` that implements the ```get_guitarist``` and ```get_band``` functions. These functions check if the given input is a valid name of a guitar player, or band respectively. They are used in the ```main.py``` file to test if a given guitar player plays in a certain band. If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py``` it will give you the following results:

```
Kirk Hammet plays for Metallica
Sorry, Young Signorino does not seem to be a known guitarist
The guitar hero of Guns'n Roses is Slash
Sorry, we don't know who is the guitar hero of Ricchi e Poveri
```

You can (optionally) add functionalities to this basic behaviour (e.g. other band members) or adapt the template for other applications like sport players and teams.
